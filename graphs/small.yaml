# Graph's number of levels
Levels: 2

# Number of nodes per level. Each level has the same amount of nodes.
NodesPerLevel: 2

# Distances from source node to the first level nodes.
# Each value represents the distance between source and node in level 1.

# Weights associated with the connection of each node in level l to each node in
# level l + 1. The key represents the level, and each matrix associated with
# that key holds the connections weights. Therefore, weights[1][1][3] holds
# the connection weight between node 1 of level 1 and node 3 of level 2.
Weights:
  1: # weight matrix of the first level nodes
    -
      - 1 # weight between node 1 and node 1 from level 2.
